# Module 2: Develop

## Develop phase

“Shifting left” is a key tenant of the DevSecOps mindset, and this process begins well before code is even committed into a repository and deployed via a pipeline, by adopting secure coding best practices and using IDE (integrated development environments) tools & plugins for code analysis during the development phase can go a long way with addressing security issues earlier in the development lifecycle when it's much easier to fix.

### Best practice - Use Integrated Development Environment (IDE) plugins 

Most popular IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse support extensions that developers can use to get immediate feedback and recommendations around potential security issues they may have introduced while writing their application code
